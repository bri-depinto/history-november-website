Victoria grew up very depressed and lonley due to the fact her only friend was her dog named Dash. Victotria used to spend her days dressing up dash in a pair or little trousers when she was not being turtered by Reverend George Davys. He started educating her at age 4 which allowed her to become the Queen of the United Kingdom at only age 18. This was only the start of Queen Victorias amazing journey.

      Queen Victoria played a vital role in helping the United Kingdom flourish economically, socially, and geographically. For instance, she aided Britainâ€™s age of industrial expansion and economic progress. Not to mention, she played a key role in imperialism which helped to shape perceptions of the British Empire and its place in the world. This therefore resulted in greater respect being given to the UK.
